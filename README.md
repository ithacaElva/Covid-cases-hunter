## This is an in-class kaggle competition. We are given features x of several countries (such as population, area, etc.), and want to predict y, the log of the number positive cases of a given country. We use the mean squared loss (MSE) of the test data as the evaluation metric (lower is better). Here, I tried several regression models, including linear regression models, logistic regression models, kernel models, random forest, lightgbm and Xgboost. And Xgboost turns to be the best models with the lowest test MSE.

# Dataset description
## Dataset splits
We have three partitions of the dataset: a training set, a validation set and a test set. They have 91, 31, and 61 data points, respectively. We provide both features x and labels y for the training set and validation set, while we only provide features x for the test set.

Other (%): Percentage of land used for other purposes (not arable or for crops).

Birthrate: The number of live births per thousand of population per year.

Deathrate: The ratio of deaths to the population of a particular area or during a particular period of time, usually calculated as the number of deaths per one thousand people per year.
